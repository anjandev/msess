Hello everyone,
 
We are excited to let everyone know that we will have a mascot survey for the MSESS mascot. 
Further details are explained in the Web Survey description in the link. 

This mascot will be featured on future crest designs which will be adopted by the MSESS primarily for the purposes of merchandise. 

1. Each submission may only nominate one mascot
2. Mascots that are nominated 15 times or more in this survey will added to a select survey and be voted
upon by MSE students to select the final winner.

Cheers, <br />
