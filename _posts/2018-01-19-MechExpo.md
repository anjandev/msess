# Letter from Organizers

Dear potential attendee,
I want to invite you to join us for MechExpo 2018, the Mechatronics Career Fair at Simon Fraser University’s Surrey Campus. Home to Mechatronic Systems Engineering (MSE) program, SFU’s Surrey Campus is an emerging technology hub where more than 600 students are working towards their MSE degree.

Mechatronic Systems Engineering is unique to combine education in mechanical, electrical, software, and systems engineering. MSE alumni successfully work in these fields in organizations ranging from small start-ups to Fortune 500 companies. Increased emphasis on effective communication and teamwork within the MSE program is what sets the students up for successful careers - a mechatronics engineer will facilitate the flow of technical knowledge within the team.

To recruit top mechatronics engineers from SFU, organizations take advantage of co-operative education (co-op) program that each MSE student is part of. Organizations offer intern positions to connect with mechatronics student talent early. Top MSE students receive job offers from their co-op employers months before they complete their degree. 

The vision of MechExpo is to provide an additional point of contact between local industry and mechatronics students at SFU. We created an event for industry representatives like you to meet aprising future engineers and gain exposure for your organization. MechExpo is the right fit for your organization if you need an engineer fluent across disciplines and trained to work in a team effecitvely. If your organization is actively hiring for co-op and full-time positions, MechExpo is a perfect place to conduct your first round of interviews and save time. In this sponsorship package, you will find career fair details, more about SFU Surrey & MSE students, and our contact information.

Thank you for your time and consideration. This event would not be possible without your support.

The Simon Fraser University [**Satellite Design Team**](http://sfusat.com/) is collaborating with the CHIME radio telescope project in investigating the expansion of the universe and the influence of dark energy. We are responsible for designing and building a flight ready satellite that is used to calibrate CHIME to facilitate precision measurements. This project is apart of a Canada-wide university competition called the Canadian Satellite Design Challenge where student organizations compete to develop satellites under the guise of industry experts and rigorous testing procedures.

![Team Phantom logo](/img/blog/2018-01-19/phantom.png "Team Phantom" ){:height="110px" width="150px" .image-clubright}
[**Team Phantom**](https://www.teamphantom.ca/) is SFU’s Electric Vehicle (EV) race team. Our mission is to inspire the innovators of next-generation EV technology by building a race vehicle to compete in the International Formula SAE  Electric Competition. Our vision is to build a high- calibre zero emission vehicle while encouraging  students to build valuable real world skills. Our first hands-on project was completing an all-electric go kart which will serve as a test-bed, learning platform and an exciting project showcase. We promote lifelong experiential learning to SFU and the greater Surrey community through workshops, hackathons, and celebrations of sustainable technology.
