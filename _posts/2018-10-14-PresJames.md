A new initiative that msess will be persuing is getting members that go to conferences to do a 10-15 minute presentation on the conference and what they learned. Since many students cannot come to the MSESS meeting we will be posting them on msess.ca for your viewing pleasure.

First up, we have James (Our VP External) presenting what he learned at President Meeting 2018 in New Brunswick. Enjoy!
