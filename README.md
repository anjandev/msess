## Docs
Written by anjan@momi.ca. Please email him if you have any questions. If you are a new VP services please read and understand all of the docs. Keep the docs updated as you fix things. Clarify and add things other VP Services may have missed. Documentation is very important and your work may be useless to a future VP Services if you do not document well. I have included notes in these guides on what you should do as soon as you are appointed as a VP services and what you should do when you are leaving the position.
