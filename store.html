             <b>The price is inclusive of a 5% fee for paying with credit card.</b>
	     <br/><br/><b>The merch is pre-order only</b>. In order to get these prices for students, we would need to order atleast 20 shirts and 30-40 hoodies (each products' prices goes down as quantity increases). Unfortunately, MSESS does not have 4000$ to buy this quantity of merch upfront and then sell the products in person (see the finances posted on the blog). Therefore, we must do preorders only.
