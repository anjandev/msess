<p>My name is Frank Chen, and I am the Co-VP of Events. I am in my 2nd year at SFU in Mechatronic Systems Engineering.</p>

<p>Encouraging engagement and communication and networking among students, alumni, professors and industry personnel would definitely make the student culture more rich and create a stronger MSE network. As your VP Events, I would like to implement many events for this type of engagement, and increase student interactions outside of the classrooms. With this being said, my position is to best provide the opportunities and events desired most by the student body, and there is no better way to make that happen then to always having feedback and consensus. Therefore, I encourage everyone to come out to events to be held to interact with one another, and definitely feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions at events@msess.ca.</p>
