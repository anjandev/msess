<p>My name is Muhammad, and I will be your VP of Events. I am a student from Toronto, ON, and I am in my 2nd year of classes at SFU in Mechatronic Systems Engineering. I have previous experience working with Non-Profit organizations, such as Canadian Federation of Students, Jarvis SC and CTYA. I have been an elected board of directorâ€™s member of CTYA and I was responsible for organizing tournaments, recognition awards galas and workshops. </p>

<p>Encouraging engagement with the student population in our program and encouraging communication and networking among students, alumni, professors and industry personnel would definitely make the student culture more rich and create a stronger MSE network. As your VP of Events, I would like to implement many events for this type of engagement, and increase student engagement outside of the classrooms. With this being said, my position is to best provide the opportunities and events desired most by the student body, and there is no better way to make that happen then to always having feedback and consensus. Therefore, I encourage everyone to come out to events to be held, interact with one another, and definitely do feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions at <a href="mailto:events@msess.ca">events@msess.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Stay blessed.</p>
