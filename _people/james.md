<p> My name is James Liu, and I will be overseeing the interactions with external student bodies and societies, as well as conference delegations, operations, logistics and travel itineraries. In short, other than the president, I will act as the face of the student society externally! </p>
<p>To give some context, our student society maintains relationships with other Canadian student societies through hosting and attending inter-societal events, competitions, and meetings through each schoolâ€™s VP External and president. </p>
<p>As well, our student society is also part of a larger student society called the Western Engineering Student Society Team (WESST). Through WESST, events like the Western Engineering Competition (WEC) are possible. </p>
<p>Within SFU, I will also be working with the departmental student unions within the Faculty of Applied Science FAS, composed of ESSS, SSSS, CSSS, and of course the MSESS. </p>
<p>I will also be responsible for planning the iron ring ceremony for MSE students, and SFU Engineering Competition for all SFU engineering students. I will be working closely with MSESS VP Finance, VP Events, and the ESSS VP External for the above. </p>
<p>Throughout the year, if you have any interest in being part of future conference delegations or any questions regarding the iron ring ceremony or SFU Engineering Competition, please do not be afraid to contact me at external@msess.ca. </p>
