<p> My name is Brindan Ramalingam. I am a fourth-year student at SFU majoring in Mechatronic Systems Engineering. Over the course of the past four years, I have met a bunch of amazing peers, professionals and mentors and came to love one of the (supposedly) toughest majors offered by SFU. I am no stranger to procrastinating on the numerous second year lab reports or the amazing hands on third year projects.</p>

<p>I have been elected as the President for the Mechatronic Systems Engineering Student Society for the year 2018-2019. Over this time, I will be counselling and overseeing the student societyâ€™s activities. A lot of students think that the student society does not really do much. While it is true that we cannot bump up your grades, we can talk to the Professors, Co-op and course advisors regarding any concerns or constructive comments you may have. You can email me at bramalin@sfu.ca or at president@msess.ca. We will be releasing office hours shortly for you to chat in person and maybe play smash bros.</p>
